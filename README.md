### ML algorithms
An repository containing raw implementation of some of the ML algorithms .

Completed till now
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Softmax


### TODO 
1. Ensure that the data is colum [ x1, x2, x3 , x4] where x1 is a column vector containing all the features for training data row 1 and so on
2. Ensure weights are colum [w1, w2, w3, w4] where w1 is a column vector containing weights of each feature so that when we dot product it would be np.dot(w.T, X)
