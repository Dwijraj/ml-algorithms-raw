1. Deep learning at it's very crux is just layers of matrix multiplication. 
2. The training process of deep learning contains 3 main steps 
    a. Forward propagation :- We predict based on our paramters the label and calculate the error using suitable loss function.
    b. Gradient calculation :- We find the gradient of our parameters w , b wrt to the loss function to determine how much to change and which direction.
    c. Backward propagation :- We update the parameters in the reverse order 
    Z = WX+B 
    A = ActivationFunction(Z)
    Z1 =
